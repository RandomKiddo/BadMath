### Goal

This repository is a proof-of-concept repository. It is supposed to be lightweight and humorous. This repository uses Java's internal reflect library to mess up the internal integer mathematics, so you can get funny things like 1+1=-56. This only works for methods `System.out.printf` or by setting variables like `Integer i = 1 + 1;`. If you do `System.out.println(1+1);`, the output is still `2`.
